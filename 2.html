<h2>Square - 백예린</h2>
<p>
  All the colors and personalities

  you can’t see right through what I truly am

  you’re hurting me without noticing

  I’m so, so broke like someone just robbed me

  I’m no invincible

  I have much memories of getting more weaker

  I know I’m not loveable

  but you know what you’d have to say

  “Come on let’s go to bed

  we gonna rock the night away

  who did that to you, babe

  If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then,

  Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day

  would you want me in bae

  If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then

  come take my arms and go

  I’II be yours for sure”

  All the traces and reminiscences

  You can’t sense right through how I truly was

  You were gripping me without noticing

  Was so, so strange like Someone never loved me

  I’m no invincible

  I have much memories of getting more weaker

  I know I’m not loveable

  but you know what you’d have to say

  “Come on let’s go to bed

  we gonna rock the night away!

  who did that to you, babe

  If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then,

  Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day

  would you want me, in bae

  If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then

  come take my arms and go

  I’ll be yours for sure”

  You’re the only one, who saw my yesterday

  the one who knows I’m here alive today

  Comfort me say, what I’m meant to you

  you should know what you have to say

  “Come on let’s go to bed

  we gonna rock the night away

  who did that to you, babe

  If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then,

  Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day

  would you want me in, bae

  If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then

  come, take my arms and go

  I’ll be yours for sure”</p>
